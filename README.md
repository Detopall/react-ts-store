# React TS Store

This project is a react typescript store which allows the user to choose between 20 items and add them to a cart. I've used React BrowserRouting, Switches, Routes ... to route the home page and cart page. The products come from an external API "https://fakestoreapi.com/products". With this I've used async await with react and typescript.
